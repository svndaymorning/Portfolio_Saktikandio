# Secure Voice Communication on iOS  
Bluetooth-Based Voice Chat Application (Objective-C | GameKit)

This project explores how iOS devices can communicate voice data directly using Bluetooth, without relying on internet connectivity, while still considering privacy, security, and real world constraints.
Originally developed as my undergraduate final project, this application reflects my interest in understanding Apple native technologies at a deeper, system level.

## Problem
How can two iOS devices communicate real-time voice data directly using Bluetooth while keeping the communication secure, stable, and usable?

## Approach
- Established device to device communication using Bluetooth (nearby peer-to-peer)
- Implemented real time voice transmission between iOS devices
- Applied AES-256 encryption to protect transmitted voice data
- Focused on stability and clarity rather than additional features
- Used Apple native frameworks to understand their capabilities and limitations

## Technologies Used
- Language: Objective-C  
- Frameworks: GameKit, AVFoundation  
- Audio Session: Play & Record  
- Security: AES-256 encryption
